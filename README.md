# Phishing Detection Web Page

A Python-based web application to detect phishing URLs and enhance online security.

## 📌 Introduction

Phishing is a cybercrime where attackers create fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate ones to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, and personal data. This project provides a **web-based tool** to analyze URLs and determine if they are phishing attempts.

## 🚀 Features

- **User-friendly interface** to check suspicious URLs.
- **Real-time detection** of phishing threats.
- **Django-based backend** for efficient processing.
- **Input validation** to ensure correct URL formats.
- **Clear result display** to help users understand potential threats.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language for processing.
- **Django** – Web framework for backend development.
- **HTML, CSS,**– Frontend technologies for user interaction.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User Input** – The user enters a URL.
2. **Validation** – The system checks if the URL format is correct.
3. **Processing** – The backend analyzes the URL using predefined algorithms.
4. **Result Display** – The system shows whether the URL is safe or a phishing attempt.

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

Include screenshots of your web interface and result display.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RajeshJinagam/Phishing-detection.git
   cd Phishing-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**  
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Django server**  
   ```sh

   ```

5. **Open in Browser**  
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to use the tool.

## 📌 Usage

1. Enter a URL into the input field.
2. Click the "Check URL" button.
3. View the result indicating whether the URL is **safe** or **phishing**.

## 📖 Future Enhancements

- Implement **AI-based phishing detection**.
- Add **database storage** for previously analyzed URLs.
- Develop **browser extensions** for real-time alerts.
